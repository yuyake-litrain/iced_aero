# iced_aero
Testing the representation of Windows Vista's Aero theme UI with iced.\
This is a **work in progress** and is **not intended** for use as a library for production purposes.

This is a learning project aimed at enabling me to master the expressive power of iced's custom widgets, and there are no plans for future development.
